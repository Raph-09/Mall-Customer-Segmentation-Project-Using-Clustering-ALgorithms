The following steps where followed:

1) iImportation of Python Libraries For The Project

2)  Get data from Source

3) Loading and preprocessing of data

4) Exploratory Data Analysis

5) Feature Selection

6) Feature Transformation


7) KMeans Clustering


8) DBSCAN Clustering Model


 9) Models Performance And Evaluation Using Sihoutte Coefficient


10) Impact Of Clustering Analysis On The Business Decision Making

# Performance Evaluation
For KMEANS
The sihoutte score is 0.45
For DBSCAN
The sihoutte score is 0.20
