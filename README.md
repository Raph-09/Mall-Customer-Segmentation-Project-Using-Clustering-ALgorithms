3) Loading and preprocessing of data

4) Exploratory Data Analysis

5) Feature Selection

6) Feature Transformation


7) KMeans Clustering


8) DBSCAN Clustering Model


 9) Models Performance And Evaluation Using Sihoutte Coefficient


10) Impact Of Clustering Analysis On The Business Decision Making
